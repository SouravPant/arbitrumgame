Improve the UI and UX of my Notcoin-inspired tap game for Farcaster mini-app with the following changes:

🎨 General UI Polish
- Use a modern, minimal, and playful theme inspired by Notcoin.
- Add smooth animations when tapping (button pulse, glow, and particle bursts).
- Center align the main tap button with a futuristic gradient background (blue → purple).
- Replace plain progress bars with rounded, animated ones.
- Use meaningful icons (⚡, ⭐, ⬆️) instead of only text.
- Ensure responsive design for mobile and desktop.

⚡ Tap Button Enhancement
- Make the main tap button circular, glowing with neon edges.
- Add ripple animation and particle bursts (sparks/coins) on tap.
- Change button color dynamically by level (e.g., L1: Blue, L2: Green, L3: Purple).
- Add subtle vibration feedback (if supported).

📈 Level & Progression
- Replace plain XP bar with a glowing segmented progress bar.
- Animate level-up with popup text and confetti effect (“Level Up! 🎉”).
- Show next target clearly (e.g., “Reach 1.6K taps for Level 4”).
- Add crown/badge icon next to current level.

🔋 Power-ups Section
- Redesign power-ups as rounded glowing cards with hover/tap effects.
- Locked power-ups should appear greyed out with a lock icon.
- Add icons for each power-up (⚡ Energy, ⬆️ Level Up, 🔗 Sync Wallet).
- Add progress indicators under each power-up to show affordability.

🔗 Wallet & Blockchain Integration
- Show wallet address in a stylish rounded card with copy-to-clipboard.
- Add chain/network icon (Ethereum/Arbitrum logo) next to name.
- Show green check ✅ when wallet sync succeeds, red ❌ when disconnected.
- Add subtle animation when wallet status changes.

🎮 Extra Gamification
- Add daily rewards popup with claim button.
- Show tap streak multiplier for continuous tapping.
- Add simple sound effects for tapping and leveling up (toggleable in settings).
- Prepare a button for future leaderboard integration.

Make sure the overall design feels polished, fun, and engaging while keeping a clean minimal aesthetic. Add smooth transitions and animations everywhere possible to create a rewarding experience.
